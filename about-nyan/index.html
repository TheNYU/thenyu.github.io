<h2 id="whatsnyan">What's Nyan ?</h2>

<p>Nyan is a game engine. A game engine is a set of functions which covers all the needed to create a video game. A game engine deals with graphics, sounds or input for instance. <br />
The game engine for RPG Maker XP, RPG Maker VX or RPG Maker VX Ace is called RGSS. Nyan is an alternative to RGSS. Its goal is to improve performances and possibilities. Nyan is also using Ruby, as RGSS, and is compatible with most of existing scripts. In most cases, you can switch from RGSS to Nyan without changing a single line of code. <br />
The following is an overview of Nyan's features.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="betterperformances">Better performances</h2>

<h4 id="generalimprovements">General improvements</h4>

<p>Nyan is offering better performances than the official RGSS. Thus, the game is less laggy and makes a better use of memory.  </p>

<h4 id="threadcompatible">Thread-compatible</h4>

<p>Nyan is also using Ruby's Threads. It's a class in Ruby's core which deals with multi-threading. That means that the computer can now execute multiple blocks of code in a same time. For instance, you can now create loading screens and preloading some assets, images or sounds.  </p>

<h4 id="anewversionforruby">A new version for Ruby</h4>

<p>Nyan uses one of the last versions of Ruby. While RPG Maker XP was using Ruby 1.8.7, RPG Maker VX Ruby 1.9.1 and RPG Maker VX Ace Ruby 1.9.2, Nyan uses Ruby 2.3.2 and benefits from a important performance improvement.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="nyanisbetterthanyourscripts">Nyan is better than your scripts</h2>

<h4 id="multiresolutionsupport">Multi-resolution support</h4>

<p>Many games are using scripts to change the screen resolution. Nyan offers a simple and native alternative: you can now use the resolution you want and change it during the game. Nyan is also using a zoom system, which works really nice with retro games or for players who think that the game is too little.  </p>

<h4 id="nicefullscreen">Nice fullscreen</h4>

<p>Default fullscreen in RPG Maker is often blurry and distorted following the screen used. Nyan fixes that issue with a pixel-perfect fullscreen and black rectangles on the side to prevent distortion.  </p>

<h4 id="mouseandkeyboardsupport">Mouse and keyboard support</h4>

<p>A lot of games are using mouse. However, mouse in RGSS is often laggy and can create bugs. Nyan offers a native support for mouse to prevent fps drops and bugs. Nyan is also packed with a full keyboard support and with the possibility to enter characters' names with keyboard.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="someimprovements">Some improvements</h2>

<h4 id="afulluisystem">A full UI system</h4>

<p>Nyan is packed with its own UI system with a DSL syntax to simplify UI creation and divides the number of lines required by ten. <br />
A little software to create UIs without code can be created in the future.  </p>

<h4 id="ananimationsystem">An animation system</h4>

<p>An animation system is also included. You can use the Robert Penner's well-known easing function to improve the visual quality of your game.  </p>

<h4 id="networkmodule">Network module</h4>

<p>A network module was added. It deals with server exchange: it can send requests, receive responses but also download some data or send informations. This module is designed to works with PHP servers but also NodeJS servers to create for instance online battle systems.  </p>

<h4 id="opengl">OpenGL</h4>

<p>OpenGL is available with Nyan. Programmers can add 3D or shaders to theirs games without lag with the class OpenGL Api.  </p>

<h4 id="crossplateform">Cross-plateform</h4>

<p>Nyan is cross-plateform. Actually, Nyan can work on Windows but also on Mac and Linux. Moreover, with some programing basis, you can port your game to Android or iOS and share it on mobile devices too.  </p>

<h4 id="100rubyopensource">100% Ruby &amp; open source</h4>

<p>Nyan is coded in Ruby: it's more convenient to extend or modify the engine if you need to. The source code is available on GitHub.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="codeside">Code-side</h2>

<h4 id="moreconciseandefficientsyntax">More concise and efficient syntax</h4>

<p>Programmers will find a syntax more efficient than the RGSS one.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">@sprite = Sprite.new.dsl do
  x 10
  y 20
  bitmap = Bitmap.new("image.png").dsl do
    fill_rect Rect.new(x:0,y:20,width:10,height:30), :blue
    draw_line [0,0], [12,20], :red
  end
  opacity 140
end  
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <code>dsl</code> method to initialize a DSL block and the <code>set</code> method to use keywords arguments.  </p>

<h4 id="passblockstoinputmethods">Pass blocks to Input methods</h4>

<p>You can now pass blocks to Input-related methods.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">Input.trigger?(:A) {  
  puts "A triggered!"
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's also possible for most of the methods returning a boolean: the block is executed if <code>true</code>.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># Default syntax
if @sprite.mouse_over?  
  puts "The mouse is over the sprite"
end

# New syntax
@sprite.mouse_over? {
  puts "The mouse is over the sprite"
}
</code></pre>

<p>The old syntax is however correct ans usable.  </p>

<h4 id="generalimprovements">General improvements</h4>

<p>A lot of class were improved and new methods were added. You can see all the changes in the <a href="../doc/index.html">documentation</a>. Sometimes, it's a improvement on the syntax or a new way to achieve something. Nyan was designed to improve efficiency and productivity. Code is more concise and simple.</p>

<h2 id="andnow">And now ?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="../downloads/index.html">download Nyan</a></li>
<li>Then take a look to our <a href="../getting-started/index.html">guide</a></li>
<li>You can also go to see some <a href="../tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a> to learn cool stuff</li>
<li>See the <a href="../documentation/index.html">documentation</a> if you want to reeeeaaaaaad</li>
<li>Et eventually have fun!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="samequestions">Same questions</h2>

<p><strong>When did the project started ?</strong></p>

<p>The project started in 2011 in my mind but I was lacking experience. It became a real true thing in October 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Is my project compatible with Nyan ?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I think. But some special scripts can be buggy and Nyan is here to replace them. You can follow this guide to migrate: <a href="../tutorials-migration/index.html">How to migrate from RGSS to Nyan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is my RPG Maker MV project compatible ?</strong></p>

<p>Well, no. Only RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace are supported.</p>

<p><strong>Why is <random function> missing ?</strong></p>

<p>Some functions are not really crucial. For instance, playing movies is not planed in Nyan.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use Nyan without RPG Maker ?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, Nyan is independent from RPG Maker. You can code all your game in Ruby.</p>

<p><strong>Is Nyan free ?</strong></p>

<p>Of course. And forever.</p>

<p><strong>Can I sell my game made with Nyan ?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. You just have to mention my name (NYU) and the name of Nyan but you can sell your game without any restriction or royalities. </p>

<p><strong>Can I sell Nyan ?</strong></p>

<p>That's not really ethic, it is ?</p>

<p><strong>I found a bug! What can i do ?</strong></p>

<p>You can create an issue on GitHub and I will try to fix it.</p>

<p><strong>What's it means 'Nyan' ?</strong></p>

<p>RGSS — Hey! I'm da bo$$! 8D <br />
Nyan — *kicks out RGSS* Now, I'm RGSS. <br />
Me — <strong>N</strong>o, <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>a</strong>re <strong>n</strong>ot. <br />
Nyan — DDDDDDD': *cries*</p>

<p><strong>Who is the developer of Nyan ?</strong></p>

<p>It's me. If you want to learn some useless things about me... <a href="../about-me/index.html">you can</a>.</p>
